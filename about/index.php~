<h2>About Silent Echoes Media</h2>
<h3>Story</h3>
In 1999 Dan Dart started making a game called Bitbmon. Bitbmon was later renamed to Webtex. Webtex was then  merged into a bigger company to enable Dan to make more games and software, called Danssoftware. In the process, Dan, at only 10 years old, had already created a library program for his school's computers in BASIC. The name "Danssoftware" was thought to be too common, so years later Dan renamed it JolHarg. JolHarg then merged with TruffAnimation from Colin Kinloch to create a bigger company handling animations and movies as well as software and games. JolHarg was thought to be too non-descriptive, so the company went through a series of quick name-changes, through Dart-Kinloch Enterprises, B-Dash Media and was finally renamed to Silent Echoes Media. Ever since, Silent Echoes has continued to create top-quality software, games, animations and movies.
